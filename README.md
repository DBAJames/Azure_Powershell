# Azure_Powershell

These scripts set up a small azure environment, with a basic storage account and a SQL database. With more to follow.....

Run_setup.ps1 will create the environment.


burn_everything.ps1, will as the name implies burn everything.
The only thing it doesn't burn, is the Active Directory collection. You need this to be able to log in :)
